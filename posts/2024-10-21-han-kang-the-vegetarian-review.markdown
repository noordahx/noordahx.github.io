After the recent news about South Korean author [Han Kang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Kang) winning the Nobel Prize and, prior to that, the International Booker  Prize, I loaded up my Kindle with her books. I decided to start with ‘The Vegetarian’, and here is my small review of this book.

## The title

The first thing that caught my attention is the book's name - 'The Vegetarian'. It could evoke different emotional responses in people. One might get interested in anticipating a story about vegetarianism, while others can skip thinking the title is unrelated to them. However, as cliche as it may sound, I assure you not to judge the book by its title. There are almost no points in judging the moral standpoint of vegetarianism.

## The weirdness

Another thing the reader is exposed to starting from the book's first page is the melancholic and slow-paced atmosphere that I earlier caught in Murakami's works. That also highlights some similarities in modern Japanese and Korean literature. Back to the subheading, I decided to classify the book as weird because of the unique plot that starts off with, I believe, judging the standpoint of the traditional Korean households' conservative and abusive aspects. It especially highlights the influence of norms, hierarchies, and other perspectives on relationships within the family. Although I am not so familiar with Korean culture and have more yet to explore, I got the impression that East Asian culture may have radical or more conservative criticisms of how people dress, eat or behave. At some point, it becomes a principle and ego-crushing for some parents if their children have opposing views, no matter how right or wrong they are.

### The perspectives

Apart from the above, the main reason that 'The Vegetarian' might spark people's attention is the book's unique structure. It is the first book on my list that tells the story from different perspectives of different characters. Each chapter opened up a whole new way to look into the issues arising in the book. The author made me feel judgemental, manic and sympathetic towards Yeong-hye, the story's main character.

### The philosophy

The main thing that I got from the book that touched me and slightly shifted my life lens is that every one of us is a step closer to turning into a tree; however, we still find a way to stay human. As In-hye  whispered to Yeong-hye's ears:

> ___"What I'm trying to say...
Perhaps this is all a kind of dream.
I have dreams too, you know. Dreams...and I could let myself dissolve into them, let them take me over...but surely the dream isn't all there is? We have to wake up at some point, don't we?___

While she had a clear reason that kept her awake at some point, I  believe many of us are living like zombies, half in our dreams and half-conscious, still looking for the reason that can keep us awake.

## My rating

Along with my subjective opinions, I would like to add a subjective rating to the book to keep reviews structured. 

**7/10**
